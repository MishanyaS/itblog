The design of the software product is dominated by orange color. This is done for the following reasons:
+ Association with energy and innovation: Orange is often associated with energy, enthusiasm and creativity. It is great for IT portals, where the latest technological innovations, developments and innovations are actively discussed.
+ Eye-Catching and Distinctive Design: The color orange draws the attention of users and helps create a memorable visual style for the portal. It is bright, lively and different from traditional color schemes, which allows IT portals to stand out from many other sites.
+ Tech brand association: Some big IT companies like Orange use orange in their logos and branding. The use of orange on IT portals can create an association with such successful technology companies and reinforce the impression of reliability and quality.
+ Readability and Contrast: Orange has a fairly high contrast with black or white text, which makes it easier to read and improves visual navigation on the portal.
